This directory contains data used during the design and measurement collaboration example. Each directory contains files exported from native CAD (CATIA V5, Creo, and NX) to .stp with assigned UUIDs for each of four  design iterations described below.

Default organization:
Each source file will have its own subdirectory (by the basename of the file).

Rev 0.0:
- A plate with a 19 diameter hole located at (3.2, 6.4, 10).

      Additional information:

      Model units: mm

      Plate Dimensions: 50.8 x 76.2 x 10

      Datum A in the positive direction

      Creo absolute accuracy = .009906 mm

Rev 0.1:
- The 19 diameter hole was moved to (-8.3, 8.9, 10).

Rev 0.2:
- The hole feature was deleted and a new diameter 19 hole feature was created at (-6.3, 6.9, 10).
