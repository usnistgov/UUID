## Purpose
This repository contains a dataset used in the investigation of Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) that will enable a standards-based digital thread of product data. Included are the long-form EXPRESS schema that includes new EXPRESS constructs proposed in this research (based on ISO 10303-242, Managed model-based 3D engineering) used for trial implementation.
The publication is available free from charge at [https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-12](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.300-12)
